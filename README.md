# CPU Scheduling Agent

A simple CPU Scheduling agent that uses **Reinforcement Learning** to decide which process to schedule next.  

This is a very basic implementation. The agent is simple and does **not perform optimally**.

## Features

- Implements a reinforcement learning agent for CPU scheduling.  
- Built using Gymnasium environments.  
- Uses Stable-Baselines3 for training the agent.  

## Requirements

Install the required Python packages:  

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
